# Task-tracker LiaisonIC
A simple real-time task tracker. JS/Nodejs/Express/Socket.io

LiaisonIC is a simple project tracker. It can be used by a team when working on a project.  Team members can collaborate on a project in real-time keeping things updated.
Sometimes team members can perform redundant tasks due to the lack of communication. LiaisonIC can come in handy to avoid this type of inefficiencies.  A team member just needs to post their activities that will be added up to the task list and remain visible to the whole team.
When a team member finishes their task they just hit “DONE” and the task list will be updated for the whole team.
When a team member leaves the app, his status updates for the rest of the users.
